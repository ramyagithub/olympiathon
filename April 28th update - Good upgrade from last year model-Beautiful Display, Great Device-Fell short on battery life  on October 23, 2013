April 28th update - Good upgrade from last year model-Beautiful Display, Great Device-Fell short on battery life  on October 23, 2013
on May 28, 2015 This must be great-- I gave it to my wife a month ago and haven't seen it since. No, seriously, this device has revolutionized our lives. She can lie in bed and watch TV, listen to an audiobook or music, or just read a book or magazine. The options presented with the Kindle Fire are almost limitless!
